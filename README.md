# Try Out Development Containers: Clojure

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**  extension for **[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)** in a few easy steps. This repository is inspired from the [vscode-remote-try-* repos from Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vscode-remote-try-).

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.
